	/// The If action is used to perform a conditional branch to control the actions
	/// executed by the Flash Player.
	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// When executed, the If action pops a value from the stack and evaluates it to
	/// see whether it evaluates as true or false. If the boolean value is true the
	/// offset attribute of the If action is added to the Flash Player's instruction
	/// pointer and execution of the stream of actions continues from that location.
	/// If the boolean value is false then no branch is taken.
	/// </para>
	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// Although the Flash Player contains an instruction pointer it does not support
	/// an explicit address space. The instruction pointer is used to reference
	/// actions within the current stream of actions being executed whether they are
	/// associated with a given frame, button or movie clip. The value contained in
	/// the instruction pointer is the address relative to the start of the current
	/// stream.
	/// </para>
	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// The offset is a signed number, allowing branches up to -32768 to 32767 bytes.
	/// The instruction pointer points to the next instruction in the stream of
	/// actions being executed so specifying an offset of zero will have no effect on
	/// the sequence of instructions executed.
	/// </para>
	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// If the value popped off the stack is a number it is evaluated as true if it
	/// is non-zero. If the value is a string it is evaluated to true if it is not an
	/// empty string ("") or the strings "0" or "false".
